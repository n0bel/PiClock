# Overview of the PiClock

## Introduction

The PiClock is a clock (duh), weather forcast, and radar map display
based on the Raspberry Pi and a display monitor. The display monitor is
assumed to be an HDMI monitor, but it will probably (possibly) work with
the composite output as well, but this is not a design goal.  The main
program (Clock/PyQtPiClock.py) will also run on Windows, Mac, and Linux,
as long as Python 3 and PyQt5 is installed.

The current weather and forcast data comes from your choice of either
OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/) or Tomorrow (https://www.tomorrow.io/).
The maps come from your choice of either Mapbox (https://mapbox.com/) or 
Google Maps (https://developers.google.com/maps).
**You must get API keys from one each of those weather and map services in order to make
this work.** They offer free subscription plans for low-usage projects such as this application.

The PiClock can be customized with several supported additional things:
  * RGB LED strips (NeoPixel) to create an ambilight effect
  * gpio buttons for changing the view
  * IR Remote Control for changing the view
  * Streaming the NOAA weather radio stream for your area

The power usage I've measured is about 35watts with a 19" HDMI Monitor, 27 LEDs and the Pi.
The LEDs contributed 3 or so watts, and I think the Pi is about 2-3 Watts normally.

This is the basic PiClock, with some options added.

I chose to remove the plastic frame from my monitor and mount the Pi directly
on it, as well as tap power from the display's power supply.

I've made it work on multiple platforms and form factors.

And I've made some for friends and family with different customizations.

## List of materials

So what do you need to build a PiClock?

  * A Raspberry Pi (revision 2) Model B, or B+ or Pi 2 Model B
  * A Display Monitor & Cable
  * Power Supply (or if you are ambitious, tap your display power supply,
    you'll probably need a switching down regulator to 5v)  Remember
    the Pi likes something that can source up to 2A.
  * A USB Keyboard and Mouse for setup. If you want something small
    and semi-permanent, I've had good luck with this:
    https://www.google.com/search?q=iPazzPort+2.4G+Mini+Wireless+Keyboard
    I like the one with the touchpad on the side
  * USB Wi-Fi or Internet Connection

Optional things

  * One or more DS18B20s for showing the indoor temperature: https://www.google.com/search?q=ds18b20
  * A string of WS2818 based RGB LEDs for the AmbiLight effect.  At 40ma per LED, and 30 or so
    LEDs you're quickly up to needing an extra 1.2A from the power supply.  Size it appropriately.
    One option is: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/overview
  * A TSOP4838 IR Receiver to flip the page display of the PiClock: https://www.google.com/search?q=tsop4838
  * An IR Remote control. I use this little guy: https://www.google.com/search?q=Mini+Universal+Infrared+IR+TV+Set+Remote+Control+Keychain
  * Button or buttons connected to some GPIO pins (and a ground pin) for flipping pages like the IR remote

## What else?

The [Hardware Guide](Hardware.md)
gives more details about how to wire/connect the various extras.

The [Install Guide](Install.md)
steps through all the things that you need to do to a stock Raspberry Pi image to make the PiClock work.

## Not a Pi Person?

If you want to use the PiClock on a different desktop (not your Raspberry Pi), I've created instructions for that:

## History

It all started one Saturday afternoon when I was feeling bored.  My super duper radio
controlled clock (you know those AccuRite clocks) was WRONG!.    Apparently the
daylight savings time adjustment was coded to the pre-2007 dates.   I was going
to go get something new... when I spotted an unused monitor in the corner of my
living room...  My eyes flicked back and forth between it and the wall.  I had
recently been playing with a Raspberry Pi Model B, and of course the idea was born.

The initial clock was built as a static web page hosted in the Pi itself and run from
the Midori browser in kiosk mode.  Javascript and Ajax methods were used to pull
the forecast from some free weather site (don't remember) and the local NWS radar
image.  The Pi ran at about 60% cpu, having to move the second hand once per second
while re-rendering the other hands and clock face layers.

After well over a year, and some minor changes, I decided to give it a facelift,
change the weather to Weather Underground and the background maps to Google Maps.
Well the Midori browser really had a tough time keeping up with all that going on.
You could see it skipping past seconds two at a time.  And the animated radar
GIFs would stall more often than not.  Yes I tried Ephemeral and it was worse!

I decided to rewrite the whole thing in Python.  Why?  I decided I needed to learn
Python in more than a passing way. For some (unfathomable reason to me) Python is
the language of choice for Pi's.  It took a while to settle on a GUI framework.
The primary issue on most of the GUIs was lack of image transparency support.
Qt5 and its Python wrapper PyQt5 is what I finally chose.
