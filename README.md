# PiClock
A Fancy Clock built around a monitor and a Raspberry Pi

This project started out as a way to waste a Saturday afternoon.
I had a Raspberry Pi and an extra monitor and had just taken down an analog clock from my livingroom wall.
I was contemplating getting a radio sync'ed analog clock to replace it, so I didn't have to worry about
it being accurate.

But instead the PiClock was born.

The early days and evolution of it are chronicled on my blog http://n0bel.net/v1/index.php/projects/raspberry-pi-clock

If you want to build your own, I'd suggest starting with the overview
https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock/blob/master/Documentation/Overview.md

If you want to use the PiClock on your desktop (not your Pi), I'd suggest using these instructions.
https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock/blob/master/Documentation/Install-Clock-Only.md

All of the extra hardware (IR Remote, GPIO buttons, Temperature, LEDs) are optional, so you can then jump to the install guide
https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock/blob/master/Documentation/Install.md

Of course you can jump to the hardware guide anytime https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock/blob/master/Documentation/Hardware.md
